What is HTTP/1.1?
The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. Because it went through several stages of development, this first
version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still in use on the web.

What is HTTP/2?
In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created. HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1
did not anticipate. In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. One of the ways in which
HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.
